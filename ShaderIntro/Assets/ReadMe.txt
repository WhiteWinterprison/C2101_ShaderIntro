Read ME : 

All shaders submitted for grading are found in the folder Isable in the Assets. 
All models I made myself  and all textures used are drawn by my friend, and she gave me the right to use them.

I really enjoyed the course and will definite continue working with shaders and also get deeper into the coding part.  
I am looking forward to the chance of a next shader elective.
